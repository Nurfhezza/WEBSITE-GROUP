          Kuih Cincin is a traditional biscuit popular among the Brunei-Malay and Bajau communities in Sabah. It is made from a mixture of wheat flour, rice flour, brown sugar, white sugar, and cooking oil. The kuih is fried twice to produce a texture that is crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.
          <br><br>
          There are two variations of Kuih Cincin: the hard version (Iranun style) and the soft version (Brunei-Malay style). The soft version is also crunchy but has a softer texture and is usually sweeter. The dark brown Kuih Cincin contains more brown sugar. This kuih is known for its sweet aroma with a hint of coconut and is often served during celebrations and family events. Despite its name meaning "ring cake," this kuih is more akin to a biscuit than a cake. Its shape resembles a round floral design, giving it a unique and attractive appearance.

      <p>Ambuyat is an iconic traditional dish in Brunei, made from sago flour mixed with hot water to form a chewy gel. It is eaten by rolling it using a chandas, a type of bamboo fork, and dipping it into various types of sauces, such as cacah, which is made from tempoyak (fermented durian) or a mixture of sour fruits, chili, and shrimp paste. Uniquely, ambuyat is not chewed but swallowed directly, offering a unique and different dining experience.<br><br>This dish was first introduced during World War II when Brunei was under Japanese occupation. At that time, food supplies were very limited because the Japanese soldiers received supplies first, forcing the locals to find alternatives from their surroundings. They discovered sago as a food source that could replace their daily nutritional needs.</p>
